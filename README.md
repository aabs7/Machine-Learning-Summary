# Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow (A quick summary)
This repository contains summary with implementation of book [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/).

Although the visualization of required data or datasets are covered in the book and notebook, the materials below will help you understand data visualization in more depth.
##### Materials for Data Visualization :
- [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW3oco7nlV4)
- [Slide](https://amueller.github.io/COMS4995-s20/slides/aml-02-matplotlib/#1)
- [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/)
- [Systematising glyph design for visualization](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:b98ccce1-038f-4c0a-a259-7f53dfe06ac7)
